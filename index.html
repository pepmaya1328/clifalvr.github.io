                    <h3>Calle Crisologo</h3>
                    <p>Though only 500 meters long, Calle Crisologo in Vigan, Ilocos Sur, is one of the most beautiful streets in the Philippines. It boasts centuries-old stone houses, lovely tungsten lamps, and antique cobblestone, where horse-drawn carriages or kalesas are still used for transport. In fact, the street is a pedestrian-only zone, save for kalesas favored for touring the historical sites around town. A few of the ancestral houses have also become restaurants that serve the famous Ilocos bagnet (deep fried pork belly) or empanadas. Meanwhile, others have been converted into inns and souvenir shops for traditional Inabel linen.</p>

                    <p>The Baluarte Zoo was established by local politician and businessman, Chavit Singson. Initially it was only a rest house for Singson. The site was already known as Baluarte prior to Singson's arrival, which came from the Spanish term for "stronghold" or "fortress". Singson, who cites his hunting hobby as his motive in setting up Baluarte only considered opening a zoo when his hunting trophy collection grew too big. He thought that a zoo would serve to edify it patrons aside from promoting conservation and protection of endangered species.Described as an interactive wildlife sanctuary, the facility was designed and developed by Singson himself.</p>

                    <h3>Bantay Church Bell Tower</h3>
                    <p>Bantay Church is a Roman Catholic church in the Ilocos town of the same name. Also known as the Saint Augustine Parish Church, it’s one of the oldest surviving churches in the region dating back to 1591. Bantay Church is also famed for its grand design and architecture inspired by Western and European cultures. This tower, which stands on the top of a hill just a short distance from the church, is where Filipinos guarding the Bantay and Vigan towns positioned themselves to see any impending attacks from foreign enemies. This is also how the town got its name, as bantay means “to guard.”</p>

                    <h3>Hidden Garden</h3>
                    <p>Vigan’s so called Hidden Garden is not really hidden at all. Well, it is way out from the city center, and one needs to either ride a tricycle or hire a calesa to access it, so I guess it is partly hidden in a way. The sprawling garden started out as a personal venture for retired engineer, Francis Flores. It started to really blossom and guests started to pour in. Eventually, he opened the place to the public in 1991 and it became one of the usual stops with the calesa tours in Vigan.</p>

                    <h3>Vigan Cathedral</h3> 
                    <p>One of the country’s oldest Augustinian churches, the St. Paul Metropolitan Cathedral started out as a chapel made of wood and thatch in 1578 by order of Juan de Salcedo, the conquistador and founder of Villa Ferdinandina, which later became the town of Vigan. When the seat of the Nueva Segovia Diocese was transferred to Villa Fernandina de Vigan from Cagayan’s Lal-lo in 1758, the church was elevated to the status of a cathedral and became the center of Catholic faith in the north. Another structure was ordered by then Governor Jose de Basco to be built to replace the existing church in 1786. With the Augustinians, the cornerstone of the new church was laid in the beginning of 1790.</p>

                        <h3>Loving the horses.</h3>
                        <p>We took a tricycle that took us right to Calle Crisologo, which is a famous street which serves as a major attraction for tourists coming through Vigan. It was a very picturesque little street I'd have to say; and it had lots of cute souvenir shops and these little horse-drawn carriages were riding through the street continuously. This street actually gets his major charm from the Spanish houses alongside, where the rich people lived during the Spanish era. The town itself had huge Spanish colonial influences conjointly. It was a charming little street.</p>

                        <h3>On one side the mountains; on the other side the city.</h3>
                        <p>We didn't have all that much time but another major attraction in Vigan would be the Bantay Watchtower. Being a short tricycle ride away from Calle Crisologo, we decided this should be our second and final stop for our little tour through Vigan. It was located just near Bantay Church, a famous catholic church in Vigan city. I vlogged some and was happy to take my drone in the air, for a nice aerial tour over Vigan city and around the watchtower.</p>

                        <h3>Vigan Empanada and Sinanglaw!</h3>
                        <p>Kick started my day with something uniquely Vigan. Walked to the “Empanadaan” at Jacinto Street, near Plaza Burgos. The area had a row of stalls selling Vigan’s famous emapanadas and other local dishes. The empanadas were indeed tasty but I was craving for a full breakfast. Got myself a bowl of Sinanglaw. Sinanglaw is an invigorating soup of beef skin and innards. Pairs great with rice and a bottle of coke.</p>
